# Optic-Disk

The prevalence of myopia is a major concern worldwide. Optic disc tilt (ODT), peripapillary atrophy (PPA) and abnormally large or small optic discs are the earliest known changes occurring in myopic eyes and may precede the development of pathological myopia[1]. In this project, we investigated the optic nerve head characteristics in both emmetropic and myopic subjects. We quantitatively measured three different newly developed image processing techniques and clinical expert methods too. The optic disc tilt was calculated both in horizontal and vertical. 

The horizontal optic disc tilt was noted both in emmetropic and myopic eyes. We used 18 images for subjects with subjects with emmetropia and 24 images for subjects with myopia. The maximum value of tilt was 18.4 (7.9 - 22.2) horizontally and 14.7 (9.7 - 18.5) vertically. An insignificant difference between emmetropic and myopic eyes observed by all four methods. However, the maximum horizontal tilt was noted in method II between emmetropic and myopic eyes.
